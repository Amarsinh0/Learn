        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Suppose you have a scenario where you want to prevent a specific EC2 instance from accessing a particular S3 bucket. You can create an IAM policy that explicitly denies access to the S3 bucket and then attach this policy to the IAM Role associated with the EC2 instance. This policy will override any permissions that allow access to the S3 bucket and effectively deny access.\n",
